# Deque
# Group assignment used to test understanding of deque by making own custom deque class
# Set up a menu that interacts with user to edit the deque. They can add to the deque, either 1 at a time or in bulk via an input file (we have provided you with two). They can also get rid of data in the deque and can view info about the deque, such as its size, the first or last element in the deque, or whether or not the deque is empty.
# We managed to get everything working
# We met up in the CS lab and worked together on separate machines on different functions and talked with each other on how they would be implemented and how troubleshoot any problems we had.
# The executable to run the code is ./deque .
