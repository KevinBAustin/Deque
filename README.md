# Deque
#Group assignment used to test understanding of deque by making own custom deque class
#Set up a menu that interacts with user to edit the deque. They can add(either 1 at time or in bulk), can get rid of, and can view info about the deque.
#We managed to get everything working
#We met up in the CS lab and worked together on separate machines on different functions and talked with each other on how they would be implemented and how troubleshoot any problems we had.
